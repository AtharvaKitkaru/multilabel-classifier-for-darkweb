# A Hybrid TF-IDF and RNN Model for Multi-label Classification of the Deep and Dark Web

This repository contains the code and data for the paper "A Hybrid TF-IDF and RNN Model for Multi-label Classification of the Deep and Dark Web" by Ashwini Dalvi et al., published in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), Volume 14, Issue 7, 2023.

## Abstract

The classification of content on the deep and dark web has been a topic of interest for researchers. Researchers focus on adopting more efficient and effective classification methods as the data available on deep and dark web platforms continues to grow. Multi-label classification is the approach for simultaneously categorizing content into multiple classes. To address this, a hybrid approach combining Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been proposed. The approach involves preprocessing a dataset of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents, selecting specific HTML tags to generate embeddings using TF-IDF, and using an RNN model for multi-label classification. The proposed model was evaluated against commonly used methods (Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, and Label Powerset) using precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics, demonstrating promising results in accurately classifying data from the deep and dark web. This contribution represents a noteworthy advancement for researchers and analysts working in this field.

## Key Points

- The paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for multi-label classification of deep and dark web content, which combines TF-IDF and RNN techniques.
- The paper collects and preprocesses a large dataset of HTML documents from the deep and dark web using a custom crawler and various data cleaning techniques.
- The paper uses FastText to generate embeddings of the selected tokens from the HTML documents and assigns them to predefined categories based on their similarity.
- The paper trains and evaluates an RNN model using the assigned categories as labels and compares its performance with three existing methods: Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, and Label Powerset.
- The paper demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms the other methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score for most of the categories and provides insights into the factors affecting the multi-label classification performance.
